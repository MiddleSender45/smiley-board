This is an LED chaser, that flashes lights across the board in a smiley face. The power comes from a 2-pin connector mounted on the back. The flashing sequence is commanded by the 555 IC timer, and the flashing of the LEDs id carried out by the NE555P IC. The flashing rate is adjustable by dialing the knob of the potentiometer.
